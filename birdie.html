                        <p>I was finishing up the rest of my website, and I wanted to add a secret page on it for you because I wanted a place to keep stuff for you instead of having it everywhere and also I kind of just wanted to thank you for last night(although by the time you see this, it will not have been last night), because it really meant a lot to me that you were able to calm me down and get me to go to sleep. Feel free to explore the rest of my website, but be a little careful on the blog part because my thoughts get a little intense sometimes and I don't want you to worry about me when it's just my weekly spiral. I'm praying this won't look completely crazy on opera since I'm testing it on google because I'm boring. If it does look weird, then tell me and I'll try to fix it, but I don't really know what I'm doing so I can't guarantee it'll work.</p>

                        <p>Originally, most of these were written on a typewriter but I'm putting some more that I'm writitng on here because it's a lot more quiet so I can write them whenever I want. The letters will have a little synopsis and any warnings at the beginning if there's something that's less sunshine and rainbows, but I promise it's all just love letters. Unfortunately, to close the dropdowns, you will have to reload the page because javascript is confusing, but hopefully the text will appear. Some of them are longer than others, and most of them have some sort of information that is outdated, but I hope you can appreciate them anyways. I have physical copies of the first four letters in chronological order, so if you want them, then tell me and I'll give them to you.</p>

I've also been thinking a lot about the future and that's scary, but it's less scary because I can be scared with you. I don't really know what the future holds, but I'm praying you're in it because you make me feel so loved, and like I'm enough. I rambled a good bit on my blog today about what I hope the future holds, and you're welcome to go look at it. Even if you don't look at it, I want to share my favorite part, which is where I hope that one night a week(I specified Thursdays on my blog post because of vibes) we'd try and cook a meal together and make a complete mess, but the mess wouldn't really matter because the food would be decent and we'll have bonded over our lack of cooking skills.</p><p>I get scared thinking about the future and all the stuff we're going to have to do or figure out, but I try to remember to take things one day at a time, and I don't really know why I'm saying it in this letter, besides the fact that I found it helpful, so maybe you would too. I have a habit of constantly thinking about the end goal and all the things down the line I'll have to do to get there, when really there are a lot of little, very manageable things to do before that.</p><p>I like our evening phonecalls that we sometimes have because it's just really nice to talk to you. I like it when you ramble a little bit because, like I said last night, I love how you think. I'd love to build a little house in your mind and just live there because I bet it's really nice. I hope that made sense.</p><p>Basically, I love you, and the future is scary, but I think we'll make it, and once we do, it'll be really nice.<p/><p>Love, Peter <3</p>"

My depression really only gets bad in the evenings, but I really appreciate you laying with me on the phone and telling me it'll be alright.

It's a lot more relaxed than my house, and I really liked that. You have no idea how nice it was to lay in your bed with you. Also the sex was amazing. I still don't think my brain has recovered from that lol.

This is one of the ones written on my typewriter, so it mentions it in the letter. It's kind of a heavy one, so I don't expect you to read it, but I wanted to put it here anyways, just in case.</i></p><p>December 10, 2025</p><p>Hi Abe,</p><p>I kind of keep writing these letters because it's easier to say the things I want to say when I know I'm not catching you off-guard, even though what's going into them has changed a good bit. I really wish we both weren't depressed right now. I don't really know what's going on with you right now, but I kind of know what's going on with me. I'm probably going to be back in the php over winter break cause I've been feeling like shit. I really hope you're doiong better than I am, but if you're not then that's okay. I was thinking it would be funny in kind of a morbid way if we ended up in the php at the same time again. Obviously I don't want that to happen because I don't want you to have to feel that bad. I'm just kind of amused at the thought. I don't really know where I'm going with this.</p><p>I'm really glad I have you. Last night we didn't really text beyond just saying goodnight, but it made me really happy just to see your usual response of 'goodnight, i love you too'. You used more punctuation than that, but my typewriter doesn't have an exclamation mark or a heart emoji so I had to make due with what I had.</p><p>On a different note, you definitely gave me the cold you had. It's honestly a bit novel to me because it's such a normal teenager type thing to happen. It's the only cold I think I've ever enjoyed having, and it's also not a bad one, which is nice. I just really like that we've managed to survive this long, and hopefully we'll survive a lot longer.</p><p>I love you so much, and I hope you start feeling better soon.</p><p>Love, Peter</p>";

If it goes terribly, I'm sorry lol.

ALso I forgot to double space this paragraph.</p><p>In other news, I spent most of today deciding whether I wanted to go to pvpa or this homeschooling type thing that seems cool. I think I've decided on pvpa and if that doesn't work out, then homeschooling. It would be nice to talk that through with you, but I'm trying not to bother you. I'm still a little unsure in my decision but I'm making my parents sign the paperwork tonight so I can't go back on it. It'll be fine.</p><p>Anyways, I love you so much and I hope you feel better soon(It looks vaguely like spoon, I know, and speaking of spoon, have we tried that? Because I feel like I'd like that.

This one is mostly about how I can't always fix things but I'll always be here for you the best that I can. It's a little rambly and it's pretty long but it's kind of sweet I think? This is the one I told you about that one time, so like you know, it's a little intense.</i></p><p>December 8, 2025</p><p>Hey Birdie,</p><p>You came over last night and I think we were both doing pretty badly. I know everything has been a lot for you lately, and I really hope it gets better soon. I love you so much and I hate to see you like this, but just know that I'm always here for you. Even if I'm not in a place ot be able to listen, I'm always able to just sit and be sad with you. I know that there's not a whole lot I can do to fix things, but I'll do what I can</p><p>On a bit of a werid note, I kind of liked when we made the 'IT'LL BE OKAY' bracelets last night. Not because I know it'll be okay, becuase I don't know that, really, but because it felt kind of nice to do that kind of thing with another person who feels euqally as shitty. I don't know if you do that kind of thing a lot- where you're doing a thing and pretending that that one simple thing will make it all better, even when you konw it probably won't. It was just nice to not feel alone in that feeling.</p><p>I can't immediately make things better for you, or maybe even make them better at all, but I wish I could. Like I said earlier in the letter, I might not always be able to listen, but I can always sit with you. There's this tumblr post I saw a few weeks ago that was like, 'the opposite of sadness isn't happinesss, it's warmth'. I don't know if that makes any sense to you, but if it does, then I hope I can be a little bit of warmth for you.</p><p>I think I'll elaborate a bit further on that quote, just to make sure we're on the same page about it, but if you think you already get it, then feel free to skip this paragraph. Basically what it's saying is that being happy isn't how you fix being sad or depressed, because feeling like that is usually caused by something, so doing something unrelated that's happy might not fix the problem, because sometimes what you need is just someone to sit with you. I don't know if that explanation acutally made it make more sense, but I'm pretending it did and I'm moving on.</p><p>Life is hard sometimes, and it's hard to know what happens next. I think that's been weighing on both of us. It's hard for me to believe that everything will be okay, hence me saying earlier in this letter that I don't know that it will be, but things have a funny way of working themselves out. It takes time and work, but I promise that things won't be terrible forever. There's this Against Me! song lyric that goes, 'All moments meant to pass'. The song is appropriately titled, 'Fuckmylife666'. And it means one thing in the context of the song, but to me, it also means something on it's own. To me, it means that everything ends, whether it's good or bad, and that's kind of just how life works. There's going to be ups and downs, but I know that we can get through it. We survived long enough to meet each other, and I know we'll survive longer.</p><p>This was kind of a long and rambly letter, but I hope it gets the point across that I love you and that I hope things get better soon. I was planning on adding this to my little stash of letters I wrote to you that I'll probably give to you eventually, but I think I might transcribe this into a text message later because I'd really like you to know this. I'd tell you right now but I'm pretty sure you're at school right now(I took the day off for mental health), so I'll probably tell you around 5:30-ish becaue it's Monday and I'm pretty sure you have Headgear today, and if I'm correct, then you said it ends at five. I could be completely wrong because my memory is shit, but yeah.</p><p>I love you so much, and I really hope that things get better soon.</p><p>Love, Peter</p>"

I'm really looking forward to seeing you on Sunday, because texting and phonecalls are nice, and I like them, but they just don't beat seeing you in person and actually getting to hold you.</p><p>I love how we're both 'freaky', as you say, in the same ways. You make me feel understood(I can't remember if I said that in the last letter, but I'm saying it again because I can). I love how we think in the same ways, and it's always so easy to talk to you, Long story short, you make me really happy, and if there's anything I can do for you, I'll try to do it because I want you to feel loved and cared for because you are genuninely such an amazing person.</p><p>I've never met anyone like you, and I don't think I ever will again because you are so special and unique in all the right ways.
