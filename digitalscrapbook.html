            <h1>Welcome To My Digital Scrapbook!</h1>
            <p>I've gotten into scrapbooking recently and I wanted to try to put a digital one on here so I can work on it when I don't have access to my supplies for my physical one!</p>
            <p>This is currently under construction, so don't judge too hard.</p>
            <p><a href="index.html">Back to main</a></p>
            <div class = "page">
                <p class="title">Why I Love Folk Punk</p>
                <p>-The lyrics! They're painfully honest in a way that most music isn't.</p>
                <p>-There's like one guy that makes most of the music for the genre, so it's predictable. *cough* Pat the Bunny *cough*</p>
                <p>-The instrumentation makes me think of being at Dollywood. I think I still miss tennesee.</p>
                <p>-When it talks about self-destruction, it's about how it's bad and hopefully that's better for my brain to hear than depressing stuff without hope.</p>
