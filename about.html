                <p>Interests: NBC Hannibal, My Chemical Romance, music in general, Road 96(aka the best game ever), and gamedev, so like coding and stuff and making video games. I might post devlogs here for the game I'm making.</p>

I also have the most amazing parter, who I'll refer to as Birdie on here. My parents are crazy so I'll probably post stuff about that here too.</p>
